#Custom Set

Implement a `Set` class using TDD to store an unordered collection with primitive data types. The `Set` should expose methods to manipulate the collection for:
- checking if there is any element in the collection
- return size of collection
- add element to collection
- check if element is present in the collection
- remove element from collection

- simulating static type languages where you have to define the size of the `Set` at creation, implement a solution for allocating memory dynamically (every time a new element is needed). See `fixed_size_array.rb` for a fixed size array.
