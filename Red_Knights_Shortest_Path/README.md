# Red Knight's Shortest Path

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/red-knights-shortest-path/problem



Step 1:
 - [x] iterate over all possibilities to get shortest path.
 
Step 2:
 - [ ] optimise by: when one path is found, all next iterations should not continue if their current path is bigger then the found one.    
 
Step 3
 - [x] since there are no obstacles it can be optimised by filtering only movements that get you closer to subject.
